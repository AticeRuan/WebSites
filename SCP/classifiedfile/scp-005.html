      <h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
      <p>
        SCP-005 poses no immediate risk in any direct sense. Even so, its unique
        functions require special measures be taken to restrict access and
        manipulation of the object. Approval of at least one (1) Level 4
        personnel is required for the removal of the object from its containment
        area.
      </p>

      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>
        In appearance, SCP-005 resembles an ornate key, displaying the
        characteristics of a typical mass produced key used in the 1920s. The
        key was discovered when a civilian used it to infiltrate a high security
        facility. SCP-005 seems to have the unique ability to open any and all
        forms of lock (See Appendix A), be they mechanical or digital, with
        relative ease. The origin of this ability has yet to be determined.
      </p>

      <h3>Additional Notes:</h3>
      <p>
        SCP-005 may be used as a replacement for lost security passes, but only
        under the supervision of at least one (1) Level 4 personnel. SCP-005 may
        not be used for vending machine repairs, opening lockers, or for any
        personnel's spare home key. Removal of the object from the compound will
        result in immediate termination.
      </p>
      <h3>Appendix A:</h3>
      <p>
        While SCP-005 has been shown to be effective in removing almost any form
        of locking device, further experiments have shown that efforts to
        disguise the purpose or identity of a lock have proven at least somewhat
        successful in defeating SCP-005's ability. In approximately 50% of cases
        where a volunteer was not able to identify a locking device as such,
        SCP-005 was not successful in deactivating the device. Due to these
        results, SCP-005 has been tentatively classified as 'sentient' and
        further tests are being run to determine its cognitive abilities.
        However, there are no results that show any traits that prevent it from
        being able to identify any particular locking device, only that the
        aforementioned device has been heavily concealed and disguised.
