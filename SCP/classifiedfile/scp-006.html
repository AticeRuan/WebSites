      <h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
      <p>
        Whereas the nature of SCP-006 does not warrant any extensive
        containment, a certain level of secrecy is necessary regarding the
        object's existence and properties, for obvious reasons. The following
        procedures are required not for personnel safety, but to deny or hide
        knowledge of SCP-006's effects from the personnel who interact with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        1: All personnel interacting with SCP-006 in any physical way are
        required to wear modified Class VI BNC suits. Before personnel are
        allowed to perform procedures, they must be briefed with Material
        SCP-006B or SCP-006C. SCP-006A Briefing is the correct one and is
        restricted to only those with O5 clearance. To ensure personnel are
        wearing suits properly, they are to be submerged into a pool of water.
        Any air bubbles spotted signify a leak in the suit.
      </p>

      <p>
        2: Procedures with SCP-006 are to be carried out under extreme
        surveillance. In case of contact with SCP-006, the commander in charge
        will announce Procedure 006-Xi-12, which the personnel have been briefed
        to believe to mean high toxicity is present and they must evacuate.
      </p>
      <p>
        3: Any procedure in which liquid is acquired from SCP-006 must be
        approved by three (3) O5 level personnel. The liquid is to be
        transferred in a Quad-Sealant Container and under armed guard.
      </p>
      <p>
        4: If at any time personnel come into contact with SCP-006 or liquid
        from SCP-006, they are to be confined and terminated after sufficient
        studies are done. Due to the nature of SCP-006, the most effective
        termination method is incineration. (For full report, see file
        SCP006-TerO5)
      </p>

      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>
        SCP-006 is a very small spring located 60 km west of Astrakhan.
        Foundation Command was aware of its existence since the 19th century,
        but were unable to secure it until 1991 due to political reasons. On the
        spot of the spring, a chemical factory has been constructed as a
        disguise, with the majority of laborers under Foundation and/or Russian
        control. The liquid emitted from the spring has been chemically
        identified as simple mineral water in 1902, but has the unusual property
        of "health".
      </p>
      <p>
        Ingesting the liquid produces the following properties in human beings:
        the ability to regenerate DNA damaged by sufficient duplication,
        heightened excitement of cellular duplication, vastly improved abilities
        in the repair of damaged tissue, and a frightening increase in the
        effectiveness of the human immune system. Upon testing the liquid on
        animal subjects, hostile bacteria and viral agents were destroyed
        immediately. Many reptiles and birds were unaffected, while higher
        primates experienced the same benefits as humans.
